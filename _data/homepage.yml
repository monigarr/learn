  title: "About the Course"
  first_paragraph: "<p>The shift from personal computers to mobile devices and internet of things is one of the most exciting technology changes of our time.</p>
  <p>Today, a growing number of entrepreneurs create mobile apps with templates that are created from scratch by experienced software engineers. 
  They turn their mobile app ideas into making thousands or in some cases over a hundred thousand dollars in monthly income.</p>
  <p>The benefits of building and selling your own mobile apps is a nice side income that turns more passive after the groundwork
  and allows you to work from anywhere you choose (home, office, while traveling).</p>
  <p>How did this come to be? In recent years, all the parts you need to build and sell mobile apps – the best 
  practices, industry standards, technologies, publishing and distribution channels – have all become available for anyone to use and re-use.</p>
  <p><strong>
  <span class='underline'>MoniGarr Online Courses</span></strong> provide comprehensive video lessons that 
   take you behind the scenes and teach you everything you need to quickly build and sell your own mobile apps to help solve real world issues including Indigenous Language revival.</p>
  <p>If you ask a software publishing company to build an app for you that is similar to what you will build in this course, you might
  get a similar response as this one: <img src="learn/images/223551_10151411264941590_1323942744_n.jpg"></p>
  <p>You will be led by Monica Peters, Founder of the independent 
  online school MoniGarr. She’ll show you every aspect of building & selling mobile apps from the beginning with an idea, to verifying
  if your app idea is going to bring income for you, to building it from scratch or with templates, to selling it in stores
  worldwide or internally as an enterprise private app, to marketing it and to building your own mobile app empire.

    - question: "When will this course open?"
      answer: "We're looking to launch the course for a couple of days around June 25th. After opening enrollments a couple of days, we are going to focus on helping students inside the course achieve results.

    - question: "Is there any specialized equipment that I will need?"
      answer: "You will need an internet connection and laptop with OS X for Android and IPhone app development. If you only plan to develop Android mobile apps you can use a computer or laptop with windows or linux operating system. I recommend an apple computer with OS X so you can build and sell for the most popular mobile devices. We'll walk you through obtaining your software and licenses. Additionally, all the templates and source code discussed in the course will be available for anyone who purchases the course."
    - question: "What is the refund policy?"
